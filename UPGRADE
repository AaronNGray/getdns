Back up the old installation

If desired, back up the existing installation (the directory structure in the
User Guide is a useful reference) and database. 


1. Pre-installation

1.1 Install new dependancies
Install additional packages

sudo apt-get install libyaml-tiny-perl

Install additional R packages

sudo R
install.packages(c("dplyr"))
q()

1.2 Download, configure and make new release

Download the code from github:

wget https://github.com/dns-stats/hedgehog/archive/2.0.0b2.tar.gz

tar -xzf 2.0.0b2.tar.gz
cd hedgehog-2.0.0.b2
./autogen.sh
mkdir build
cd build
../configure
make

1.3 Cron jobs

Stop refile and grok cron job running:

sudo -u hedgegho crontab -e
# Import XML data every 15 mins
00,15,30,45 * * * * <prefix>/bin/refile_and_grok.sh -c >> /home/hedgehog/refile_and_grok_xml_to_db.sh.log 2>&1

Comment out any other jobs that are about to run. If the dsc-extractor process 
is running wait for it to finish before continuing.

1.4 Disable web front end

It is recommended to disable the web front end during upgrade e.g by enabling a 
holding page.


2 Installation

2.1 Install new release

cd hedgehog-2.0.0b2/build
sudo make install
sudo make install-rpg

Note: 'make install-rpg' is required in addition to make install. It installs an
R package to assist with the database connection.

2.2 Remove moved/deleted files

Some files were moved or deleted between b1 and b2. To clean the install 
directory run the following commands

sudo rm -rf <prefix>/sbin/hedgehog_database_create.d/
sudo rm     <prefix>/bin/conf_read.sh

2.3 Update configuration settings

2.3.1 <prefix>/etc/hedgehog/hedgehog.yaml 
 
In 2.0.0b2 the format of this file has changed as additional parameters have been added.
* The installed 2.0.0b1 hedgehog.yaml file is not overwritten by the 2.0.0b2 installation.
* A 2.0.0b2 sample file is installed in <prefix>/etc/hedgehoghedgehog.yaml.sample. 
* If default parameters were used in 2.0.0b1, then simply copy the sample file 
  into place using the command below. 
  Otherwise a manual migration to the new file format is required.

sudo cp <prefix>/etc/hedgehog/hedgehog.yaml.sample <prefix>/etc/hedgehog/hedgehog.yaml

2.3.2 <prefix>/etc/hedgehog/hedgehog_gui.yaml 

In 2.0.0b2 the default setting for the default_interactive_plot_type has changed
from flash to svg. 

* The installed 2.0.0b1 hedgehog.yaml file will not have been overwritten by the
  installation. 
* A 2.0.0b2 sample file is installed in <prefix>/etc/hedgehoghedgehog_gui.yaml.sample.

2.4 Upgrade database

Note that the 000009_ddl_node_index.sh script requires user input and it is
recommended to read the usage (use the -h flag) before running this script.

sudo -u hedgehog /<prefix>/bin/DDL_updates/000008_ddl_traffic_difference.sh
sudo -u hedgehog /<prefix>/bin/DDL_updates/000009_ddl_node_index.sh

2.5 Web cache

Axis labels have been added to the gviz plots and several minor bugs in the plots
have been fixed. If you wish to flush the cache of existing plot files so that
all plots will be re-generated with the new release then run the command below.

sudo -u hedgehog /<prefix>/bin/hedgehog_plotcache_rm_cached_plots.sh -a


3 Post-install

3.1 Test web front end

Re-enable and test the web front end. Make sure to restart apache.

sudo service apache2 reload

3.2 Re-enable cron jobs

Restart refile and grok cron job running:

sudo -u hedgehog crontab -e
# Import XML data every 15 mins
00,15,30,45 * * * * <prefix>/bin/refile_and_grok.sh -c >> /home/hedgehog/refile_and_grok_xml_to_db.sh.log 2>&1

Re-enable any other jobs that were disabled for the upgrade.
