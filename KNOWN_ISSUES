KNOWN ISSUES/LIMITATIONS: Hedgehog 2.0.0a1
-----------------------------
* Currently, the database and web front end must run on the same server.

* The full list of possible plots are displayed via the drop down menu in the 
  GUI, regardless of whether there is data in the database for the plot

* Flash is required to view interactive plots in a browser.

* Support for RSSAC reports is added for XML imports only, however extended 
  RCODES cannot be collected by the existing DSC collector so only base RCODES
  are collected and displayed. If the DSC collector is extended then further 
  work must be done in Hedgehog to also support extended RCODES

* The Unique Sources plot is not available until after the RSSAC report has 
  been generated for the date in question.

* If a user touches any controls while a query is waiting to return
  then the 'generate graph' button becomes enabled again and a second
  plot can be generated that will then over write the first.
